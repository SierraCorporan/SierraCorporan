<p>This is the best Strawberry Shortcake Recipe Step by Step!</p>

<h2>Ingrediants</h2>
<ul>
    <li>6 cups of Fresh Strawberries</li>
    <li>1/2cup white granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3 1/4 cups of all purpose flour, divided</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small cubes</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons powdered sugar</li>
    <li>2 drops vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the Strawberries. Cut the stems away from the strawberries and discard. Cut the strawberries in half, and then in either quarters or thick slices</li>
    <li>Maceerate the srawberries in sugar. Put the cut strawberries into a large bowl and sprinkle with sugar. Start with 1/4 cup of sugar and then add up to another 1/4 cup depending on how sweet your strawberries are. Gently stir the strawberries until they are all coated with some sugar. Let sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes, until the berries soften and begin to release their juices.</li>
    <li>Mash some of the strawberries. After 20 minutes or so, mash about a quarter of the berries in the bowl with a potato masher and stir to mix.You don't want to mash all the berries, just enough of them for their juices. Let sit while you bake the biscuits.</li>
    <li>Combine the dry ingrediants for the biscuits. In a large bowl, vigorously whisk together 3 cups of the flour, the sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
    <li>Work in the butter. Cut the butter into the flour mixture, either using your fingers, a pastry cutter, a fork, or a food processor, until the largest pieces of butter are the size of peas.</li>
    <li>Add the wet ingrediants. Stir together the milk and cream, add the vanilla extract. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour the milk mixture into it.Mix with a fork or wooden spoon until the mixture is just combined. It should look rather shaggy. If it is too wet to work with, sprinkle some of the remaining 1/4 cup of flour over it. Gently knead by hand a few times to form a loose ball of dough, adding more flour if needed. It should be slightly tacky but not wet.</li>
    <li>Chill the dough. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and form it into an 8-inch square, about 3/4-inch to an inch thick. Place it on a parchment or silicone-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and chill for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Bake the biscuits. Heat the oven to 425ÂºF. Remove the dough from refrigerator. Cut the dough into 9 even squares and space them about 2 inches apart from each other on the baking sheet.Bake until the biscuits are medium golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Make the whipping cream. While the biscuits are baking, whip the cream using an electric mixer, adding a drop or two of vanilla and 2 teaspoons of powdered sugar. Cover with plastic and place in the refrigerator to chill until ready to serve.</li>
    <li>Serve. Split the biscuits, if you like, and top with the macerated strawberries and whipped cream.</li>
